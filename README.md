# Want to join the [Siyelo](http://www.siyelo.com) team?

If so, we've devised a quick programming challenge that allows you to

* show off your skills
* be awesome
* have fun

And its a roundabout way of getting your CV to us.

## The Challenge: Write a Rails app that stores CV's (Résumés).

This amazing new paradigm in Curriculum Vitae (CV) management, set to revolutionize the entire Human Resources industry, consists of the following features;

* a visitor can upload their own CV (.doc, .pdf)
* a visitor can see a list of uploaded CV's (e.g. name, attachment)
* a visitor can see *your* CV (already uploaded/pre-populated)

Woo!

## What you need to do

1. Use git.
1. Create a Ruby on Rails app.
1. Write code. Commit early, commit often - we'd like to see your commit log.
1. Zip up your modified repo and email it to [jobs@siyelo.com](mailto:jobs@siyelo.com). (don't push to GitHub, The Man might be watching.)

## Wait, you're going to post my CV online??

No, we'd like you to create a small Rails app, that when booted up (locally), will allow us to download your CV. We won't publish your CV for anyone to see.

## Increase your Karma with

* tests
* easy deployment. We'd like to: unzip, run some setup, start your app, then download your CV.
* other useful features.
