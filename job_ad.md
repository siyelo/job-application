### Company

[Siyelo](www.siyelo.com) is an established Ruby on Rails agency, with solid backing and a growing portfolio of great projects, and satisfied clients.

### Opportunity

This is an opportunity to be a part of an entrepreneurial and focused Ruby/Rails consultancy. We are looking for people with strong web development backgrounds (preferably involving RoR), with a passion for clean code and great products.

We're all "full-stack" developers, so whilst you don't necessarily need to know how to rewrite PacMan in Javascript, familiarity with jQuery and HTML/CSS (or HAML/Sass) is needed. We care about quality too. Writing tests using modern frameworks like Cucumber and Rspec should be second nature to you.

We are working on an exciting mix of improving and scaling existing apps and developing entirely new apps. Our team is fast, talented and independent, and we encourage Open Source contributions and community participation.
