## Experienced Web Developer wanted

### Company

[Siyelo](www.siyelo.com) is an international Ruby on Rails agency, with solid backing and a growing portfolio of great projects, and happy clients.

### Opportunity

This is an opportunity to be a part of an entrepreneurial and focused Ruby/Rails consultancy. We are looking for people with strong web development backgrounds, with a passion for clean code and great software.

We're all "full-stack" developers, so whilst you don't necessarily need to know how to rewrite PacMan in Javascript, familiarity with jQuery and HTML/CSS is needed. We care about quality too. Writing tests first using modern frameworks should be second nature to you.

We are working on an exciting mix of improving and scaling existing apps and developing entirely new apps. Our team is fast, talented and independent, and we encourage Open Source contributions and community participation.

### Requirements:

  - 3+ years web development or related experience
  - Experience in Object Oriented languages & domain modeling
  - Agile development practices: TDD/BDD, pair programming, OO design, refactoring
  - Relational databases: PostgreSQL or MySQL
  - English proficiency a must.

### Highly Regarded

  - Ruby / Python / Smalltalk / Java experience
  - UI/UX design (HTML, CSS, Javascript)
  - jQuery or similar framework
  - NoSQL databases
  - Open source contributions
  - Git & Github
